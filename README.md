--------------------------------------------

This is a program that involves 2 algorithms where both algorithms take in n size arrangemnet of dark and light disks that need to be ordered with the first half being light disks and second half of disks being dark. The goal is to ONLY swap them if the right disk left disk is dark, and right disk is light. 
    1.) Alertnate algorithm = sorting algorithm that compares every pair (ex, [0] & [1] -> [2] & [3] ...)
    2.) Lawnmower algoruthm = sorting algorithm that comoares every 2 adjacent indeces (ex, [0] & [1] -> [1] & [2] ...)
